PROBLEM: I/P- arr[]={10, 11, 1, 2, 3}
         O/P- 11 11 3 3 3
         
         Explain: we need to find OR of two elements and store at that position.
                  At 0th index (10 | 11), at 1st index (11 | 1), .... , at 3rd index (2 | 3) and at 4th index it remain as it is.
                  


SOLUTION:

int* game_with_number(int arr[], int n)
{
    for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
        arr[i] = (arr[i] | arr[i+1]);
    }
    return arr;
}
